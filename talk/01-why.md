## Why the Toolbox?
* 35+ Python projects, and the number still is increasing 😮‍💨
    * Reduce complexity by having common set of tools
    * Reduce complexity by hiding unecessary parts of common tools
    * Minimize/reduce cognitive overhead.
    * Provide a "central" place for project maintenance knowledge.
    * Simplify future changes/transitions (e.g., pylint/ruff, black/ruff-fmt).

::: notes
* The Integration Team has 35+ Python projects, and the number still increases 😮‍💨.
